    <h2>Article 1: How to Set Up Your Tiny Apartment</h2>
    <p style="color:#6b5b95; font-size:0.9rem;"><em>Posted on August 30, 2025</em></p>: How to Set Up Your Apartment</h2>
    <p>Welcome to your new apartment, Also known as “the place where you spend $1,000/month in rent every month.” Setting up a tiny and overpriced shared space doesn’t have to be stressful, though. Start with the basics: somewhere to sleep (bed), somewhere to sit (bed), and somewhere to study (bed). Keep things minimal because Laurier has a long laundry list of furnishings you are NOT allowed to bring.</p>
    <p>Storage will be your best friend. That guy you met in your microeconomics class? Forget him. Embrace storage. Think vertical space, under‑bed bins, and those magical command hooks that could hold up the world if need be. Lighting matters too; fluorescent overhead lights give “hospital waiting room,” not “comfy cozy,” so grab a warm lamp or two. And don’t forget a small cleaning kit. Get a broom, all‑purpose cleaner, and the courage to face whatever horrors await you under the fridge.</p>
    <p>Make the space yours with posters, stuffies, or a plant you'll definitely accidentally kill by mid-October Overall, aim for cozy, functional, and try to limit the amount of potential fire hazards (but not completely).</p>

    <h2>Article 2 (Step‑by‑Step): How to Not Go Broke in Your First Month</h2>
    <p style="color:#6b5b95; font-size:0.9rem;"><em>Posted on September 1, 2025</em></p> (Step‑by‑Step): How to Not Go Broke in Your First Month</h2>
    <p>University is basically a financial survival game where the everything around you (school included) grasps at your money. Here’s the step‑by‑step guide to keeping your wallet alive.</p>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Track your spending.</strong> Not in your head. You will lie to yourself. Use an app or I will f**king find you.</li>
      <li><strong>Make a weekly budget.</strong> Something realistic, like $40 for groceries (not just $4 on ramen).</li>
      <li><strong>Cook at home.</strong> Uber Eats is the final boss of going broke and will call out to you like the Green Goblin mask.</li>
      <li><strong>Use your student discounts.</strong> If a place offers 10% off, you say “yes please, thank you.”</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid impulse buys.</strong> Do you need that stupid looking stuffed bear? No. Will you buy it anyway? Probably.</li>
      <li><strong>Plan for surprise expenses.</strong> Midterm study note printing, random materials for a project, replacing your roommate's mug you dropped -> budget for it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you follow even half of these steps, congrats! You’re already doing better than most freshmen.</p>

    <h2>Article 3: How to Make Friends Without Being Weird...Or By Being Weird</h2>
    <p style="color:#6b5b95; font-size:0.9rem;"><em>Posted on September 3, 2025</em></p>: How to Make Friends Without Being Weird...Or By Being Weird</h2>
    <p>Making friends in university is literally just speed‑dating but with more group projects. But good news: everyone around you is just as nervous and pretending they aren’t. Start simple. Just talk to the people sitting near you in lectures. A quick “hey, do you understand the assignment?” is basically the academic version of “adopt me into your social circle.”</p>
    <p>Join clubs that actually interest you. If you force yourself into Chess Club but you hate chess, you will simply suffer. Don't listen to Taz and his Chess Club propaganda. Social events, residence activities, and study groups are all easy ways to meet people without feeling bad about existing in a conversation.</p>
    <p>And the secret tip? Always be around. Social event? Be around. Study session? Be around. It's called the "Joe Biden." Regardless, people love talking about themselves. Ask questions, laugh at their jokes (even if they’re bad), and you’re golden (hawk! ... get it? Like, Laurier Golden Hawk? haha...is this thing on?). Friendships build slowly; don’t panic if you’re not in a friend group by week 2 (I mean, I was, but not everyone can be me).</p>
